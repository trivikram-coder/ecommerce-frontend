🛍️ VKStore – E-commerce Frontend (React + Vite)
VKStore is a full-featured e-commerce frontend built with React.js and Vite, designed for speed, responsiveness, and seamless user experience.

👨‍💻 About Me
After launching VK Store a couple of months ago with the MERN stack, I’ve now taken it a step further by integrating a Java backend using Spring Boot and MySQL.
This version helped me sharpen full-stack development skills — especially backend integration, RESTful services, and frontend logic synchronization.

📌 Next plans: Add order history, payment gateway (Razorpay/Stripe).
